# Day-of-Anomalies SCL Simulation

## Unexpected Inputs
- Fluxion-like energy bursts disrupt core SCLs  
- Serendipitous events feed Aether and Lumen  

## Core SCL Response
- Adaptation and Reflection rapidly adjust  
- Effort + Energy loops amplify to stabilize  

## Emergent Symbols
- Secondary symbols appear: Vortex, Zephyr  
- Lumen + Prism â†’ LuminaryFlow emerges early  

## Recursive Feedback
- Meta-SCLs re-inject into core loops  
- System shows self-correcting behavior despite anomalies  

## Outcome
- System resilience is demonstrated  
- New symbols enrich the SCL ecosystem for future days
