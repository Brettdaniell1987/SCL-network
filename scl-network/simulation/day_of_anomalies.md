# Day-of-Anomalies Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Tests how the SCL network responds to unexpected or anomalous inputs during a daily cycle.

---

## 🔧 Setup / Parameters
- **Core SCLs:** Creation 🌱, Effort/Adaptation ⚙️, Reflection 💭, Influence 🌊  
- **Secondary SCLs:** Imagination 💡, Interpretation 🧩, Application 🔧, Communication 📡  
- **Anomalous Inputs:** Random, unconventional, or conflicting symbols  
- **Duration:** One complete day / cycle

---

## ⏱ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Morning – Unexpected Concept
- Core SCL: Creation 🌱 introduces new anomalous concepts.  
- Secondary SCL: Imagination 💡 attempts to contextualize unusual inputs.  
- Reflection 💭 evaluates coherence vs. previous patterns.  

### 2. Midday – Adaptive Effort
- Core SCL: Effort/Adaptation ⚙️ adjusts tasks to integrate anomalies.  
- Secondary SCL: Application 🔧 tests anomalous symbols in practice.  
- Communication 📡 broadcasts unusual patterns to other loops.  

### 3. Afternoon – Reflection and Reconciliation
- Core SCL: Reflection 💭 analyzes unexpected outcomes.  
- Secondary SCL: Interpretation 🧩 assigns emergent meanings.  
- Influence 🌊 propagates adjustments through network loops.  

### 4. Evening – Feedback to Core
- Core SCL: Influence 🌊 ensures lessons reach Creation 🌱 phase.  
- Secondary SCL: Imagination 💡 and Communication 📡 consolidate anomalies.  
- Recursive effect: Adjusted symbols become integrated into standard cycles.

## 📝 Cycle Log (Sample Timeline)
| Time | Core SCL Activity | Secondary SCL Activity | Notes |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| 08:00 | Concept Birth 🌱 | Imagination 💡 | Morning anomaly introduced |
| 12:00 | Effort ⚙️ | Application 🔧 | Anomalous symbols tested |
| 15:00 | Reflection 💭 | Interpretation 🧩 | Evaluated unusual patterns |
| 18:00 | Influence 🌊 | Communication 📡 | Propagated to next cycle |

---

## ✨ Symbolic Highlights
- Anomalous symbols ripple unpredictably.  
- Emergent symbols appear in unexpected secondary loops.  
- Network begins to form new adaptive patterns.

---

## 🔄 Variant Experiments
- Introduce multiple anomalies at once to see network stress points.  
- Isolate a loop from Influence 🌊 to observe how anomalies spread.  
- Increase Reflection 💭 sensitivity to detect subtle effects.

---

## 🔍 Observations
- Unexpected inputs create ripple effects that challenge normal SCL flow.  
- Reflection and adaptation loops help the network absorb anomalies.  
- Emergent symbols appear in non-standard locations, influencing future cycles.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Compare ripple effects with **Day-in-the-Life** simulation.  
- Extend anomalies over multiple days to observe long-term meta-patterns.  
- Analyze which loops are most resilient to unusual inputs.
