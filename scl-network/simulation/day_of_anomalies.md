# Day-of-Anomalies Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Tests how the SCL network responds to unexpected or anomalous inputs during a daily cycle.

---

## 🔧 Setup / Parameters
- **Core SCLs:** Creation 🌱, Effort/Adaptation ⚙️, Reflection 💭, Influence 🌊  
- **Secondary SCLs:** Imagination 💡, Interpretation 🧩, Application 🔧, Communication 📡  
- **Anomalous Inputs:** Random, unconventional, or conflicting symbols  
- **Duration:** One complete day / cycle

## ⏱ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Morning – Unexpected Concept
- Core SCL: Creation 🌱 introduces new anomalous concepts.  
- Secondary SCL: Imagination 💡 attempts to contextualize unusual inputs.  
- Reflection 💭 evaluates coherence vs. previous patterns.  

### 2. Midday – Adaptive Effort
- Core SCL: Effort/Adaptation ⚙️ adjusts tasks to integrate anomalies.  
- Secondary SCL: Application 🔧 tests anomalous symbols in practice.  
- Communication 📡 broadcasts unusual patterns to other loops.  

### 3. Afternoon – Reflection and Reconciliation
- Core SCL: Reflection 💭 analyzes unexpected outcomes.  
- Secondary SCL: Interpretation 🧩 assigns emergent meanings.  
- Influence 🌊 propagates adjustments through network loops.  

### 4. Evening – Feedback to Core
- Core SCL: Influence 🌊 ensures lessons reach Creation 🌱 phase.  
- Secondary SCL: Imagination 💡 and Communication 📡 consolidate anomalies.  
- Recursive effect: Adjusted symbols become integrated into standard cycles.

## 🔍 Observations
- Anomalous inputs create **ripples that disrupt normal patterns**.  
- Reflection and adaptive effort help the network integrate unusual symbols.  
- Emergent symbols appear in **non-standard locations**, influencing future cycles.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Track which loops are **most resilient** to anomalies.  
- Compare ripple effects with a normal “Day-in-the-Life” cycle.  
- Extend anomalies across multiple days to observe meta-pattern evolution.
