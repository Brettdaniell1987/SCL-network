# Day-of-Anomalies Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Tests how the SCL network responds to unexpected or anomalous inputs.

**Setup:**  
- Core SCLs: Creation, Effort, Reflection, Influence  
- Secondary SCLs: Imagination, Interpretation, Application, Communication  
- Introduce anomalous or disruptive signals

**Observations:**  
- Unexpected inputs cause ripple effects that alter standard patterns.  
- Reflection cycles adapt to integrate anomalies.  
- Emergent symbols can appear in unusual locations.

**Next Steps:**  
- Analyze which loops are most resilient to disruption.  
- Observe effects on recursive/meta loops over time.
