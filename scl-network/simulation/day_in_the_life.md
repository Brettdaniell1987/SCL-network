# Day-in-the-Life Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Illustrates how SCLs evolve and interact in a typical, controlled scenario.

**Setup:**  
- Core SCLs: Creation, Effort, Reflection, Influence  
- Secondary SCLs: Imagination, Interpretation, Application, Communication

**Observations:**  
- Daily SCL interactions produce expected ripple patterns.  
- Reflection and influence cycles reinforce learning.  
- Emergent symbols appear gradually over repeated cycles.

**Next Steps:**  
- Compare with “Day-of-Anomalies” to see how disruptions affect the system.  
- Track recursive evolution over multiple cycles.
