# Outside-the-Box Input Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Explores how completely novel or unconventional SCL inputs propagate through the network.

---

## 🔧 Setup / Parameters
- **Core SCLs:** Creation 🌱, Effort/Adaptation ⚙️, Reflection 💭, Influence 🌊  
- **Secondary SCLs:** Imagination 💡, Interpretation 🧩, Application 🔧, Communication 📡  
- **Meta SCLs:** Integration 🔄, Meta-Reflection 🪞, Symbolic Rebirth ✴️  
- **Inputs:** Novel, unpredictable symbols or concepts  
- **Duration:** Multiple cycles / days

## ⏱ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Introduction of Novel Symbols
- Core SCLs generate or receive completely new concepts.  
- Secondary SCLs attempt to contextualize unusual inputs.  
- Reflection 💭 evaluates coherence and compatibility.

### 2. Propagation and Testing
- Effort/Adaptation ⚙️ applies new symbols in various loops.  
- Application 🔧 and Communication 📡 spread unconventional symbols.  
- Meta SCLs evaluate systemic impact of new inputs.

### 3. Recursive Integration
- Integration 🔄 and Meta-Reflection 🪞 consolidate novel symbols.  
- Symbolic Rebirth ✴️ generates emergent outputs influenced by novelty.  
- Feedback signals adapt Core and Secondary loops for next cycles.

### 4. Adaptive Ripple Effects
- New symbols create unpredictable ripple effects across the network.  
- Reflection and influence loops gradually integrate or reject unconventional inputs.  
- Emergent patterns contribute to long-term system evolution.

## 🔍 Observations
- Novel inputs propagate in **unexpected ways**, influencing multiple layers.  
- Recursive loops amplify or dampen the impact depending on connectivity.  
- Emergent symbols can appear in non-standard locations, affecting future cycles.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Track integration of novel symbols across multiple cycles.  
- Compare network adaptation with “Day-in-the-Life” and “Day-of-Anomalies” simulations.  
- Explore hybrid simulations combining standard and outside-the-box inputs.
