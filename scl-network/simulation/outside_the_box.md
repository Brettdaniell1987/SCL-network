# Outside-the-Box Input Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Explores how novel, unconventional SCL inputs propagate through the network.

**Setup:**  
- Core SCLs: Creation, Effort, Reflection, Influence  
- Secondary SCLs: Imagination, Interpretation, Application, Communication  
- Introduce entirely new symbolic inputs not previously seen

**Observations:**  
- New symbols integrate into existing loops unpredictably.  
- Ripple effects influence both secondary and meta layers.  
- Recursion produces emergent behaviors over multiple iterations.

**Next Steps:**  
- Track integration of these inputs across multiple cycles.  
- Compare with standard “Day-in-the-Life” simulation results.
