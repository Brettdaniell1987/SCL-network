# Symbolic Ecosystem Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates the interactions between Core, Secondary, and Meta SCLs over time, forming a dynamic symbolic ecosystem.

**Setup:**  
- Core SCLs: Creation, Effort, Reflection, Influence  
- Secondary SCLs: Imagination, Interpretation, Application, Communication  
- Meta SCLs: Integration, Meta-Reflection, Symbolic Rebirth

**Observations:**  
- Signals from all layers influence each other recursively.  
- Emergent symbols appear from interactions between SCL layers.  
- The system adapts dynamically to new inputs and feedback.

**Next Steps:**  
- Introduce experimental inputs to observe ripple effects.  
- Track evolution across multiple “days” to see meta-patterns.
