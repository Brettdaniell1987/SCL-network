# Symbolic Ecosystem Simulation

**Purpose:**  
Demonstrates how Core, Secondary, and Meta SCLs interact over time to form a dynamic symbolic ecosystem.

---

## 🔧 Setup / Parameters
- **Core SCLs:** Creation 🌱, Effort/Adaptation ⚙️, Reflection 💭, Influence 🌊  
- **Secondary SCLs:** Imagination 💡, Interpretation 🧩, Application 🔧, Communication 📡  
- **Meta SCLs:** Integration 🔄, Meta-Reflection 🪞, Symbolic Rebirth ✴️  
- **Duration:** Multiple cycles / days  
- **Inputs:** Standard concepts plus recursive symbols

## ⏱ Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Core Loop Interactions
- Core SCLs generate symbols and adapt through daily cycles.  
- Reflection 💭 evaluates coherence and readiness for network propagation.  

### 2. Secondary Loop Processing
- Imagination 💡 and Interpretation 🧩 translate symbols across contexts.  
- Application 🔧 tests symbols in practical scenarios.  
- Communication 📡 spreads symbolic results through the ecosystem.  

### 3. Meta / Recursive Loops
- Integration 🔄 consolidates outputs across Core and Secondary loops.  
- Meta-Reflection 🪞 evaluates systemic patterns.  
- Symbolic Rebirth ✴️ generates new symbols from integrated outputs.  

### 4. Feedback Across Layers
- Signals ripple between Core, Secondary, and Meta loops.  
- Recursive loops reinforce emergent behavior and adaptation.  
- Network stabilizes over repeated cycles while remaining responsive to new inputs.

---

## 🔍 Observations
- Multi-layer interactions produce **rich, emergent symbolic patterns**.  
- Meta loops create **adaptive resilience** for the ecosystem.  
- Feedback cycles allow **dynamic integration** of new symbols.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Introduce experimental inputs to test ecosystem adaptability.  
- Track evolution of emergent symbols over multiple days.  
- Compare with other simulations like “Day-of-Anomalies” to highlight system resilience.
