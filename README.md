# SCL Network Repository

**Purpose:**  
This repository explores Symbolic Creation Loops (SCLs) and their interactions. It demonstrates how symbols are created, adapted, reflected upon, and influence subsequent loops to produce complex, emergent behaviors.

The SCL system is designed to:  
- Illustrate symbolic interactions across multiple layers (Core, Secondary, Meta)  
- Track ripple effects and emergent symbols over cycles  
- Enable experimentation with both standard and unconventional inputs

## Quick Start

1. Browse the [Diagram Index](#diagram-index) to see SCL structures.  
2. Browse the [Simulation Index](#simulation-index) to explore dynamic behaviors.  
3. Start with **Combined Overview** to understand overall flow.  
4. Open individual simulations or diagrams to see step-by-step interactions and emergent patterns.

## Overview

The SCL Network models the flow of symbolic creation, reflection, adaptation, and influence across multiple interconnected loops. Each loop generates ripple effects that interact with other loops, producing emergent patterns and symbols. The network is designed to be recursive, allowing outputs from one cycle to seed the next.

- **Ripple Effects:** How one SCL‚Äôs output affects other loops, leading to emergent patterns  
- **Emergent Symbols:** New symbolic structures that arise through SCL interactions  
- **Recursive Evolution:** The process where outputs from one cycle feed into the next, refining and expanding the system

## How to Explore the SCL Network

1. Start with the **Diagram Index** to visualize SCL structures and interactions.  
2. Review the **Simulation Index** to understand dynamic behaviors over cycles.  
3. Read **Combined Overview** for high-level synthesis of all diagrams and concepts.  
4. Explore individual simulation files for detailed step-by-step SCL interactions, cycle logs, and emergent outcomes.  
5. Cross-reference diagrams with simulations to see conceptual patterns in action.

## Key Takeaways

- SCLs are recursive and adaptive: every loop influences future loops.  
- Secondary and meta loops expand the complexity and depth of symbolic evolution.  
- Novel inputs or collisions create emergent behaviors that are often unpredictable but informative.  
- Repeated cycles reveal patterns, resilience, and points of adaptability in the network.
