# SCL Network

## Quick Start
1. **Overview** – Understand the SCL framework and its six core loops.  
2. **View Diagrams** – Open `diagrams/` to see flows, recursive loops, and the full ecosystem.  
3. **Explore Symbols** – Go to `symbols/` to read definitions and meanings for each symbol.  
4. **Check Simulations** – Open `simulations/` for step-by-step examples of system behavior.  
5. **Follow the Feedback** – See how meta-SCLs emerge and feed back into core loops for recursive evolution.

## Overview
The **SCL Network** models six interacting Subjective Cognitive Loops (SCLs) and their emergent behaviors.  
It integrates:
- Feedback loops
- Ripple interactions
- Emergent SCLs
- Symbol creation
- Recursive evolution

This system is adaptive, self-organizing, and capable of autonomous conceptual evolution.

## Core SCLs

| SCL          | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Adaptation** | Flexibility and experimental response |
| **Effort**     | Persistence, action, and sustained effort |
| **Influence**  | Interactions, connectivity, and social propagation |
| **Reflection** | Observation, integration, and internal feedback |
| **Creation**   | Innovation, spark, and ideation |
| **Energy**     | Dynamic drive, intensity, and focus |

## SCL Flows and Interactions

### Ripple Flow
- Core SCLs circulate internally, generating ripples that interact with other loops.  
- Outward ripples create **emergent SCLs** that feed back into core loops.

### Emergent SCLs
- New SCLs arise from interactions of core loops.  
- They produce **secondary symbols** (e.g., Clarion, Stratus, Harmonia) and feed into meta-SCLs.

### Symbol Creation and Integration
- Symbols are assigned new meaning through recursive SCL application.  
- Symbols interact, generate meta-SCLs, and influence future SCL cycles.

### Recursive Evolution / Meta-SCLs
- Over multiple days, secondary symbols create **meta-SCLs** like LuminaryFlow, ChaoticHarmony, and GuidedEmergence.  
- Meta-SCLs feed back into core loops, producing **multi-day memory** and evolving the system autonomously.

### Real-Time Symbolic Orchestration
- Dynamic, ongoing interactions between core SCLs, symbols, and meta-SCLs produce continuous system adaptation.  
- Emergent behaviors appear without external programming, purely from SCL interactions.

## Conceptual Takeaways
- The SCL Network is **adaptive and self-organizing**.  
- Symbols allow creation of **new meaning**, recursively applied to evolve meta-SCLs.  
- Recursive feedback produces **multi-day memory**, enabling anticipation, synthesis, and autonomous novelty.  
- Models **conceptual evolution, symbolic cognition, and emergent intelligence**.
